## Problem

A computer network has $n$ computers and $n-1$ connections between two computers. Information can be exchanged between every pair of computers using the connections.


Each connection has a certain transfer speed. Let $d(a,b)$ denote the transfer speed between computers $a$ and $b$, which is the speed of the slowest connection on the route between $a$ and $b$. Your task is to compute the sum of transfer speeds between all pairs of computers.


## Input


The first line contains the integer $n$: the number of computers. The computers are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.


After this, there are $n-1$ lines, which describe the connections. Each line has three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$: there is a connection between computers $a$ and $b$ with transfer speed $x$.


## Output


Print one integer: the sum of transfer speeds.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le x \le 10^6$


## Example


Input:


```
4
1 2 5
2 3 1
2 4 2
```


Output:


```
12
```


Explanation: The following figure corresponds to the sample input:



Here $d(1,2)=5$, $d(1,3)=1$, $d(1,4)=2$, $d(2,3)=1$, $d(2,4)=2$, and $d(3,4)=1$, so the sum of transfer speeds is $12$.
