## Problem

There are three common ways to traverse the nodes of a binary tree:


- Preorder: First process the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- Inorder: First process the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- Postorder: First process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.


There is a binary tree of $n$ nodes with distinct labels. You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree, and your task is to determine its postorder traversal.


## Input


The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.


After this, there are two lines describing the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree. Both lines consist of $n$ integers.


You can assume that the input corresponds to a binary tree.


## Output


Print the postorder traversal of the tree.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n \le 10^5$


## Example


Input:


```
5
5 3 2 1 4
3 5 1 2 4
```


Output:


```
3 1 4 2 5
```
