## Problem

Given an undirected weighted graph, determine for each edge the minimum spanning tree cost if the edge must be included in the spanning tree.


## Input


The first line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.


The following $m$ lines describe the edges. Each line has three integers $a$, $b$, $w$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$ with weight $w$.


You can assume that the graph is connected and simple and each edge appears at most once in the graph.


## Output


For each edge in the input order, print the minimum spanning tree cost when the edge is included.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n \le 10^5$
- $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le a,b \le n$
- $1 \le w \le 10^9$


## Example


Input:


```
5 6
1 2 4
1 3 2
2 4 2
3 4 1
3 5 4
4 5 3
```


Output:


```
10
8
8
8
9
8
```
