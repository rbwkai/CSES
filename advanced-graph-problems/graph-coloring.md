## Problem

You are given a simple graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. Your task is to use the minimum possible number of colors to color each node such that no edge connects two nodes of the same color.


## Input


The first line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered $1, 2,\dots, n$.


Then there are $m$ lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge connecting nodes $a$ and $b$.


## Output


First, print an integer $k$: the minimum number of colors.


After this, print $n$ integers $c_1, c_2,\dots, c_n$: the colors of the nodes. The colors should satisfy $1 \le c_i \le k$.


You may print any valid solution.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n \le 16$
- $0 \le m \le \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$


## Example


Input:


```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```


Output:


```
2
1 2 1 2
```
