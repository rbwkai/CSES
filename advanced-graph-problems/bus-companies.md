## Problem

There are $n$ cities and $m$ bus companies. Each bus company operates in specific cities and sells tickets for a specific price. Buying a ticket from a bus company allows you to travel between any two cities that the company operates in.


Determine the cost of the cheapest route from Syrjälä to every city.


## Input


The first line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of cities and bus companies. The cities are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$, and city $1$ is Syrjälä.


The next line has $m$ integers $c_1, c_2,\dots, c_m$: the ticket costs for each bus company.


After that, there are $m$ pairs of lines describing the cities for each bus company.


The first line of each pair has a single integer $k$: the number of cities the bus company operates in.


The second line of each pair has $k$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2,\dots, a_k$: the cities the bus company operates in.


You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrjälä to all other cities.


## Output


Print $n$ integers: the cheapest route costs from Syrjälä to cities $1,2,\dots, n$.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n, m \le 10^5$
- $1 \le c \le 10^9$
- $2 \le k \le n$
- $1 \le a \le n$
- the sum of all $k$ is at most $2 \cdot 10^5$


## Example


Input:


```
5 3
4 3 2
3
1 4 3
2
5 1
4
2 3 4 5
```


Output:


```
0 5 4 4 3
```
