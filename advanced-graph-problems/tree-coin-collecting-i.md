## Problem

You are given a tree with $n$ nodes. Some nodes contain a coin.


Your task is to answer $q$ queries of the form: what is the shortest length of a path from node $a$ to node $b$ that visits a node with a coin?


## Input


The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered $1, 2, \dots, n$.


The second line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2,\dots, c_n$. If $c_i = 1$, node $i$ has a coin. If $c_i = 0$, node $i$ doesn't have a coin. You can assume at least one node has a coin.


Then there are $n-1$ lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.


Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. Each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$: the start and end nodes.


## Output


Print $q$ integers: the answers to the queries.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le a, b \le n$


## Example


Input:


```
5 4
1 0 0 1 0
2 4
2 3
1 3
3 5
1 5
3 2
4 4
5 5
```


Output:


```
2
3
0
4
```
