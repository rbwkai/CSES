## Problem

Your task is to efficiently process the following types of queries:



Add a line $ax+b$ that is active in range $[l,r]$
Find the maximum point in any active line at position $x$

## Input


The first line has an integer $n$: the number of queries.


The following $n$ lines describe the queries. The format of each line is either "1 $a$ $b$ $l$ $r$" or "2 $x$".


## Output


Print the answer for each query of type 2. If no line is active, print NO.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $-10^9 \le a,b \le 10^9$
- $0 \le x \le 10^5$
- $0 \le l \le r \le 10^5$


## Example


Input:


```
6
1 1 2 1 3
2 3
2 4
1 0 4 1 5
2 3
2 4
```


Output:


```
5
NO
