## Problem

There are $n$ buildings in a row numbered $1, 2,\dots, n$ from left to right. You are standing to the left of the first building. You can see a building if it is taller than all buildings to its left.


Your task is to process $q$ queries: If only buildings in range $[a, b]$ existed, how many buildings would you see?


## Input


The first line has two integers $n$ and $q$: the number of buildings and queries.


The second line has $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$: the heights of the buildings.


Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$.


## Output


For each query, print one integer: the number of visible buildings.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n \le 10^5$
- $1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$
- $1 \le a \le b \le n$


## Example


Input:


```
5 3
4 1 2 2 3
1 5
2 5
3 4
```


Output:


```
1
3
1
```
