## Problem

A campground is represented as a grid where each square can contain a campsite that is either reserved or free. The distance between two squares $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is the Manhattan distance $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.


Your task is to find the distance from each free campsite to the nearest reserved campsite.


## Input


The first line has two integers $n$ and $m$:
the number of reserved and free campsites.


The next $n$ lines describe the locations of the reserved campsites. Each line has two integers $x$ and $y$.


The next $m$ lines describe the locations of the free campsites. Each line has two integers $x$ and $y$.


You can assume that each square contains at most one campsite.


## Output


Print $m$ integers: the distances from each free campsite to the nearest reserved campsite, in the input order.


## Constraints


- $1 \le n, m \le 10^5$
- $1 \le x, y \le 10^6$


## Example


Input:


```
4 2
1 1
5 2
2 6
4 7
1 3
7 5
```


Output:


```
2 5
```


Explanation: The following figure shows the map of the campground:





The distance from the first free campsite (on the left) to the nearest reserved campsite is $2$, and the distance from the second free campsite (on the right) to the nearest reserved campsite is $5$.
